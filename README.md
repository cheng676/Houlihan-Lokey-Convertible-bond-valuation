# Houlihan-Lokey-Convertible-bond-valuation
This is a practicum project advised by Houlihan Lokey's valuation bussiness line, exploring advanced methods for valuing convertible bonds by examining
the classic model: the Tsiveriotis-Fernandes (TF) model, while addressing key considerations such as credit risk, stock volatility, and market liquidity. Beginning
with a thorough data cleaning process, this work presents the implementation and error analysis of the TF model, followed by a discussion of opportunities to improve
model accuracy through enhanced parameter estimation and refined numerical schemes. Machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques
are introduced to replicate or refine the PDE solutions of the TF model, demonstrating how data-driven methods can reduce computational overhead and capture
complex market behaviors. The findings reveal that ML-based models can approach PDE-level accuracy, though challenges remain in the calibration and handling of
boundary artifacts. Future directions for refining PDE boundary conditions include integrating advanced reinforcement learning methods and incorporating real-world
factors, such as liquidity and stochastic credit spreads. This work aims to develop a more robust and scalable framework for convertible bond valuation.
